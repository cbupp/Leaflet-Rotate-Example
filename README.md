#LEAFLET ROTATION TEST

This leaflet example is using a built version of this branch: https://github.com/cbupp/Leaflet/tree/rotate-map

##Capabilites

1. Rotates the map
2. (reversely) Rotates Popups
3. (reversely) Rotates Markers
4. Compensates for the graphic clipping in the corners when rotated

##TODO

- Controls need to be rotated (panning and clicking on map)
- Tiles need to load for the "corners" when the map is rotated
